    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ancho chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chipotle chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>
        <li>2 sweet bell peppers (red, orange, yellow, or mixed), diced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole, peeled tomatoes 
            (or same amount of crushed or pur√©ed)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 (15-ounce) cans kidney beans or black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, heat the oil. 
            Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring often, for 6 minutes, or until the onions soften.
            Add the beef and salt. Cook, breaking the meat up with a potato masher 
            or the edge of a spoon, for 5 minutes, or until it is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the ancho and chipotle powders, cumin, and oregano to the pot. Cook, 
            stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the bell peppers.</li>
        <li>In a blender, pulse the tomatoes and their juices for 5 seconds to break them up. 
            Add them to the pot with the water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and simmer for a minimum of 45 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours, 
            or until the liquid is well flavored (the longer the better!). Add more hot water 
            during cooking, 1/2 cup at a time, if the mixture seems too thick.</li>
        <li>Add the beans and corn and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until hot. 
            Taste and add more salt or chili powder, if you like.</li>
        <li>Set out bowls of your favorite garnishes for serving.
            This chili keeps for about a week, covered, in the refrigerator and 
            up to 3 months when frozen.</li>
    </ol>
